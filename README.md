## Architecture

The app is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. Here's a brief overview of the different layers:

## Model: The data layer that represents the app's data and business logic. In this app, the models are the Pokemon and PokemonType structs.
View: The UI layer that displays the data to the user and handles user input. In this app, the views are implemented using SwiftUI.
ViewModel: The glue layer that connects the view and the model. The view model handles the business logic and provides the data to the view.
